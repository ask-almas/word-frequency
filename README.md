Assignment: Wikipedia Word-Frequency Dictionary
Objective:
Develop a Python server application that takes an article and a depth parameter as input, and
generates a word-frequency dictionary by traversing Wikipedia articles up to the specified depth.
Traversing Functionality:
• The application should start with the given article and retrieve its content.
• It should then identify and follow the links to other Wikipedia articles referenced within the
original article.
• This process should continue recursively, up to the specified depth parameter.
• For example, if depth is set to 2, the application should analyze the original article, the
articles referenced by the original article, and the articles referenced by those articles.
• Ensure that the traversal does not revisit articles that have already been processed to avoid
infinite loops.
Requirements:

1. APIs:
   o GET /word-frequency
   Parameters:
    article (string): The title of the Wikipedia article to start from.
    depth (int): The depth of traversal within Wikipedia articles.
   Response:
    A word-frequency dictionary that includes the count and percentage frequency of each word found
   in the traversed articles.
   o POST /keywords
   Request Body:
    article (string): The title of the Wikipedia article.
    depth (int): The depth of traversal.
    ignore_list (array[string]): A list of words to ignore.
    percentile (int): The percentile threshold for word frequency.
   Response:
    A dictionary similar to the one returned by /word-frequency, but excluding words in the ignore
   list and filtered by the specified percentile.
2. Additional Requirements:
   o No authentication is required.
   o No database is needed.
   o Include unit tests for your code.
   o You are encouraged to use AI tools if needed.
3. Submission:
   o Push your code to a GitHub repository.
   o Share the repository link with us.
